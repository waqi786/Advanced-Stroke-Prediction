## 📌 Project Overview

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. According to medical research, early identification of individuals at high risk of stroke can significantly reduce complications and save lives.  
This project aims to **predict the likelihood of a stroke based on patient medical data using machine learning models**. By analyzing real-world healthcare features such as age, BMI, blood glucose level, and lifestyle habits, the model provides a reliable prediction to support proactive healthcare interventions.

---

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the publicly available **[Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)** from Kaggle. The dataset contains important features related to patient health, demographics, and lifestyle, including:

- `gender`  
- `age`  
- `hypertension`  
- `heart_disease`  
- `ever_married`  
- `work_type`  
- `Residence_type`  
- `avg_glucose_level`  
- `bmi`  
- `smoking_status`  
- `stroke` (target variable)

The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features, requiring thorough preprocessing to train effective models.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

✅ Clean and preprocess the medical dataset  
✅ Handle missing values and encode categorical data  
✅ Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find patterns  
✅ Build classification models using machine learning  
✅ Evaluate the models with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
✅ Deploy the trained model as an interactive prediction app  
✅ Provide a clean user interface with real-time results

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology       | Purpose                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Python           | Programming language                |
| Pandas, NumPy    | Data analysis and manipulation      |
| Scikit-learn     | Machine learning library            |
| Matplotlib, Seaborn | Data visualization              |
| Gradio / Streamlit | Web app interface & deployment    |

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA revealed several key insights that guided model development:

- **Age** is a significant factor: stroke risk increases with age  
- **Heart disease** and **hypertension** have a strong positive correlation with stroke  
- **Glucose level** and **BMI** influence prediction but require normalization  
- **Smoking status** shows complex patterns depending on other features  
- Categorical features such as `work_type` and `ever_married` help differentiate stroke likelihood among different groups

Visualizations such as bar plots, heatmaps, distribution plots, and pairplots were used to highlight these relationships.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

We tested multiple models and selected the best based on evaluation metrics:

- Logistic Regression ✅  
- Random Forest ✅  
- Decision Tree  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

After comparison, **Random Forest Classifier** performed best with the highest F1-score and balanced accuracy.

## 🧪 Model Evaluation Results

| Metric      | Score (Random Forest) |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Accuracy    | 94%                    |
| Precision   | 91%                    |
| Recall      | 89%                    |
| F1 Score    | 90%                    |

In addition, we used a **confusion matrix** and **classification report** to analyze false positives and false negatives in more detail.

## 💻 App Features

We developed an **interactive stroke prediction application** using Gradio (or Streamlit) that:

- Accepts real-time input from users
- Predicts stroke risk based on trained model
- Returns a clear output:
  - ✅ **No stroke risk detected**
  - ⚠️ **High risk of stroke detected**
- Provides a clean, modern UI design
- Runs locally or can be deployed online (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud)
